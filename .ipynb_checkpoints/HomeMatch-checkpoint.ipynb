    "\n",
    "- *For the generation of listings*:\n",
    "    - The creativity of the names, descriptions and pricing of the listings isn't very diverse.\n",
    " \n",
    "I've played around with the temperature but that didn't help me much.\n",
    "If we needed to improve on this, we'd have to make the prompt a bit more elaborate.\n",
    "Or we could alter the architecture altogether and have the LLM generate each key feature separately for more control.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *For the conversational llm chain*:\n",
    "    - Sometimes the agent returns fewer than 5 listings when it could return more\n",
    "    - In follow up questions, the agent sometimes returns a single listing instead of a new top 5\n",
    "\n",
    "These could probably be improved with a better system prompt."
